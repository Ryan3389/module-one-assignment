## Name
Horiseon SEO - module one assignment 


## Description
This is a website for a marketing agency specializing in SEO and social media marketing. It outlines the benefits customers receive for their services. The goal of this project was to refactor the code to make it more accessible for users with disabilities. This was done by refactoring the HTML code, adding HTML semantic elements to the file, resulting in a better user experience for users with disabilities, while improving search results in various search engines. After this, the CSS file was also refactored by adding these new semantic selectors to better organize the code. Lastly, the CSS code was reorganized by grouping each selector together to ensure this file is more readable, easier to navigate through, so that this file is sustainable for future use. (Ex: grouping each main selector together).
